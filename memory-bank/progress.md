# Progress

## What Works
- Memory Bank directory and core files have been scaffolded.

## What's Left to Build
- Populate each Memory Bank file with project-specific details.
- Begin actual project development and document progress.

## Current Status
- Project initialization phase.
- All core documentation files are in place.

## Known Issues
- No project-specific information has been added yet.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Adopted a documentation-first workflow using the Memory Bank for all persistent context.
